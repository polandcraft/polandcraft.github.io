<p>Originally meant as a simulation for "real world" politics, /pol/andcraft was born thanks to an anonymous serverfag who took inspiration from a random image found on /pol/ of a well-built beach house, and literally 19 minutes later, started a thread with an idea to start a Autism Blocks™ server. /pol/craft was one suggestion that came into conflict with wowfags, so we opted for /pol/andcraft instead. We have been running mostly continuously since 2012, with only a few gaps of service. As you have probably guessed, this is a /pol/ server. The goal of /pol/andcraft is to establish politically based factions that will work as "governments". The server implements a custom resource pack to "increase immersion" into """politics""". Put simply, we are for political roleplaying and generally having a good damn time.

It's a pretty rules light server and the only real thing that will get you banned is combat hacking, besides that we're pretty loose about what happens.
